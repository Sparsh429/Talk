 9 Reason You Might Be Need For a Marriage Counseling
 

1. You have become more distant.


Some married couples become simple roommates after years of not interacting with one another. According to David Woodsfellow, a clinical psychologist, couples therapist, and the founder and director of the Woodsfellow Institute for Couples in Atlanta, the rate of divorce rises at certain seasons. He observes, "The very top of the first wave is at about seven years." The second wave's highest point is 21 years old. Typically, the second divorce is a growing-apart one. Avoidance is key, not combat.

Couples have said to me, "We manage a household together, but there's no intimacy or connection." However, it doesn't matter because we're both so busy," Ross says. Such a distance might persist for a long time when people ignore their loneliness and wants in favor of other pursuits in life. They look at each other and ask themselves, "Who are we as a couple now?" after something occurs to them, like retirement or becoming empty nesters. 


Couples often forget why they fell in love with each other in the first place, according to Saltz. "Life narratives, memories, and past relationships built up over an extended period of time are irreversible. 




2. You argue over money.
Couples have always had disagreements over money, but when you add in the other worries that baby boomers have as they get older, such possible health issues, fewer (and fewer) years of earning capacity, and unfavorable interest rates, you have a recipe for financial strife. According to a Harris Interactive survey, 36% of married 55–64-year-olds reported that fights with spouses over money arise.
Disagreements on how to save for and spend retirement or different spending habits may be the cause of conflicts. Stress related to financial scarcity or disparities in the way your nest fund is being invested could be present. "Strong emotions such as anger, anxiety, and envy can be triggered by money," says Ed Coambs, a financial therapist and couples counselor in Matthews, North Carolina. "It has such a high associational value with power that it can lead to an imbalance in the relationship unless the partner making less has another place of psychological influence."


Conflicts may arise from divergent spending patterns or disagreements about how to save for and spend retirement. You may be experiencing stress connected to paucity of money or inequalities in the investments made with your nest fund. Money can set off strong feelings like jealousy, rage, and anxiety, according to Ed Coambs, a couples therapist and financial therapist in Matthews, North Carolina. "It has such a high associational value with power that it can lead to an imbalance in the relationship unless the partner making less has another place of psychological influence."


​3. There has been infidelity

Seeking to mend a betrayal of trust, or to put it more bluntly, adultery, is one of the most frequent motivations for couples therapy sessions. According to data from the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, 25% of married men and 15% of married women respectively admit to having had an extramarital affair. 

Undoubtedly, cheating encompasses more than just physical betrayal. Ross notes, "Being secretive and hiding something is an emotional betrayal." "You might assume it's innocuous since you're only checking up with an old flame on Facebook. Then it suddenly becomes more than that.
How can you determine when something is too far? That is difficult. "Divorce has different meanings for many individuals," says Amy McManus, a marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles. "What matters is that within their own relationship, partners develop a common, agreed-upon definition of fidelity." 


It's best to try counseling now rather than deal with the consequences later if you're inclined to wander. Furthermore, there is undoubtedly a path back if one spouse has previously had an affair. According to Saltz, about one-third of married couples survive an affair, but often, they're the ones that seek help and try their hardest to keep their marriage intact. Indeed, as Ross points out, "having an affair is often the impetus for dealing with things that have been avoided for years." 


4. You quarrel over politics a lot.




If you and your partner are at different ends of the political spectrum, politics can lead to some fairly difficult conflicts. Politics can produce weird bedfellows. It's true that it can be difficult to "agree to disagree" in these polarizing times. A well-known 2016 survey by the Arlington, Virginia-based polling firm Wakefield Research revealed that 10% of married and single couples had broken up over political differences. 


TalktoAngel is a best therapist in India, argues that couples therapy can educate you to have "a different conversation from the one that you and your partner are having at home" in order to discuss the problems without it becoming poisonous. "It facilitates communication between you, so hopefully you don't just stick to the same old script."
Active listening is one of Ross's strategies. The speaker and the listener are involved in the process. The speaker discusses their opinions and sentiments for a predetermined amount of time, let's say two minutes. Their spouse must pay close attention as they listen and repeat what they hear without passing judgment. The two then switch places. Being heard has a powerful effect, according to Ross. "Your partner senses that you're listening in a different way and is open to that." 


Additionally crucial is the search for common ground. Even though your partner and you may hold different political opinions, you most likely share some common aims and beliefs. "When a couple comes in for therapy, they will sometimes say, 'We don't have any shared values,'" says , Dr RK Suri is a therapist in India, Therapy, he says, helps peel back the layers until you both find that commonality.
You have lots of unproductive, hurtful arguments
We all have different ways of handling conflict. Some of us thrive on confrontation; others t
urn heel when things get heated. And then there are the passive-aggressive types.
5.Large-scale arguments can leave a trail of tears and damaged emotions, but regular arguments can nevertheless be just as harmful. According to Ross, "couples get into a repetitive loop." "The argument is the same, over and over."
According to Woodsfellow, a disagreement is not always harmful; rather, it might become unhealthy depending on how parties handle the conflict. Stated differently, it's not about saying what you say; it's about saying it well. "It could be verbal abuse, like name-calling or yelling, or criticism or complaints, jabs or harsh words," he explains.
You learn how to resolve conflicts in a healthy way in couples therapy: sensibly and politely. According to Woodsfellow, it's important how the conversation starts. So try saying something more uplifting such, "Help me to understand why you feel this way," rather than something provocative like, "Why did you do this?" Change pronouns, substituting the first person (I feel like you're not hearing what I'm saying) for "you" (as in, You constantly do this), which puts the other person on the defensive. 


6. Your approaches to parenting are different.
It's not a given that you and your spouse agree on parenting strategies just because you both share a deep love for your kids. When it comes to a twentysomething son or daughter living at home or requesting financial support, for instance, your partner might be understanding, but you might be more of the "put your foot down" kind. Ross adds, "Hopefully, both of you have the best intentions for your child, though those intentions may differ for each of you." Even though you might never agree on the outcome in the end, you still need to figure out how to reach a choice that works for both of you.
According to Hertlein, the goal of couples therapy is to assist each partner in realizing how they individually contribute to the issue. "When it comes to parenting, people's decisions are frequently influenced by the family-of-origin tendency. One partner can remark, "This is how we handled it in my house when I was growing up," as an example. Hertlein suggests that discussing how issues were handled in both your partner's and your own families can provide insight into your beliefs and actions, "so the two of you can work constructively to develop a new pattern."
Examining your feelings closely is also crucial. Deep-seated shame can influence parenting decisions, especially for parents who are reluctant to enforce the law. Maybe you're overcompensating for what you think your partner hasn't been doing, or you feel like you didn't spend enough time with your child when they were growing up. According to Ross, "therapy allows us to look at the greater context and expand the lens."
7. You're undergoing a significant change.
A significant change can alter the dynamic of your relationship even if you and your partner are getting along well, according to McManus. "And conflict will arise due to disparate coping mechanisms." 


A medical condition, retirement, or the last of your children moving out could be the cause. According to Saltz, "Your children may have taken up a significant amount of time and energy in the past." After they depart, you can look at your spouse and think, "I don't know who you are," if you haven't been providing the same degree of care for your marriage. Even now, I'm not sure if I like you.
A new set of difficulties arises when you find yourself unexpectedly taking care of an ailing parent, which might take up a significant amount of your time and attention. Frustration and anger may arise if your spouse doesn't comprehend the stress or isn't helpful. Couples therapy can help you deal with the new normal by restoring the connection you and your partner once shared.​
8. The flaws in your romantic life
In the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy study, 2,371 recently divorced individuals were asked to select the reasons behind their breakup. The most common reaction, given by 47% of the participants, was a deficiency of intimacy or affection.
Some people have boring sexual lives. According to McManus, having sex might become less pleasurable after years of performing the same thing in bed. "When one partner is overly exhausted, having sex can feel like just another task to cross off the list." Some couples find that having sex might be challenging due to medical conditions, pharmaceutical side effects, and physical changes like menopause.


However, modest gestures of affection, listening to your partner's experiences, and the odd peck on the cheek can be just as meaningful in fostering a sense of connection between you and your spouse. According to McManus, there are many couples who are loving and emotionally close but not sexually intimate. "There isn't really an issue as long as you are both content with whatever your circumstances are. If one of you feels that your level of closeness is not satisfying, couples counseling can be helpful.
Talking about something this private can be tough for some people, but a skilled therapist can assist steer the discussion and should know how to help you both feel more at ease talking about sensitive topics.


9. You wish to have a civil union or prevent divorce.
According to Saltz, "[Married couples] who come in for therapy usually have considered divorce but want to see if the marriage can be saved."
Couples can have conflicting goals. While one wants to keep the relationship together, the other wants to break up or get divorced. According to McManus, in situations such as these, "discernment counseling" can assist couples in determining whether to file for divorce or what has to happen in order for them to stay together. 
Therapy might help ensure a less toxic divorce if it becomes clear that this marriage isn't meant to last. According to Ross, "not being able to let go has a lot to do with prolonged, messy divorces." "A couple can move on in a more mature way that causes less harm to everyone involved if they can process 'How did we get here?' and get past blaming each other."
